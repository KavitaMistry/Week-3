# Anaconda

I had to download Anaconda twice, because the first time, it did not want to work for me. When I tried to save the program in a certain folder, it came up with an error and did not allow me to actually install the program. 
I looked up "what am I doing wrong" into Google and managed to download the program on to my computer somehow!

## The tutorial

I followed along with the tutorial and started to get a hang of things, until..... I went on to do the wget tutorial with powershell... that's when everything fell apart, including my brain.

## The result

I did it! Only after I uninstalled it yet again, and reinstalled it. From here I managed to get everything working. My issue with the previous installation was when I typed in the command conda --version I got an error and figured it was not installed properly. But now when I do so this is what comes up![Anaconda4](Anaconda4.jpg)
