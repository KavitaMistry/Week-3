# Navigating wget

Initially, I had many struggles with getting started with wget, but thank GOODNESS for cocochantal and her tutorial on navigating it. I followed along with every step, but still got errors. I was not sure why but it kept saying that "wget is not a command" so I was not able to continue. 
Even though I had my urls.txt file in the wget-activehistory folder, and tried running my command from that folder, I kept getting the same message. 

## How I solved my own issue

Eventually I figured, okay maybe my computer wants me to put the urls.txt file in the exact same folder as the wget application, not in the wget-activehistory folder, and lo and behold she has done it. [wgetcommand](wgetcommand.jpg) . I can also see the 4 images are now in my folder! 


## Anaconda

I am having the most difficulty with Anaconda and Python. See [[Getting Anaconda Set Up]] for a complete rundown of my frustrations. I tried running the python urls.py command and this is what happened. [Anaconda1](Anaconda1.jpg)
I was very confused, so that is when I decided to check if conda and python were downloaded correctly and they were not, so I reinstalled the program.

Finally I managed to get it working! [Anaconda2](Anaconda2.jpg)
It shows red at the top because I forgot to put a space between cd and the folder... rookie mistake. But I got the urls.txt in there!

I tried running the command from the wget tutorial into powershell, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK!? 
So my brain said "try it without powershell?" and it worked! It was really cool seeing my computer do its little thing! But I managed to grab the files! [Anaconda3](Anaconda3.jpg)
