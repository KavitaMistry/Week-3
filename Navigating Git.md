# How It Started
Honestly when I first read the tutorial I had no idea what I was doing. I had a few troubles getting Git on my computer mainly because I wasn't even sure it was the right program. It is now on my computer, *I think*, and I will update this note with my step by step process going through the tutorial.

## Step 1-2 Easy Peasy
So I satrted to whiz through the first few steps once I got the hang of things, and then *Step 3* hit.

## Step 3 the uphill battle

I got a little lost. I typed in git status and this is what came up... [Step3](Step3.jpg) I am not entirely sure what I am looking at, and there seems to be a lot of red. After reading on, apparently that is okay?

## Step 4 lost me a little

So apparently I was not using the proper syntax when trying to add in my [[Naan Recipe]] and it wouldn't work. I tried it with the .md at the end and then without, still nothing. So I ended up adding things all at once using git add -A and this popped up. [Step4](Step4.jpg)

## Step 5-6 feeling like a hacker

I managed to make it to step 5 alive and see some things change which was really cool. It looks like I have saved some files! Green makes me feel like I did something right. [Step5](Step5.jpg)

## Step 7-8 had me in the first half not going to lie

I navigated to [Github](https://github.com) and went to me [Week 3](https://https://github.com/KavitaMistry/Week-3) repository. From there I grabbed the link and put it in my command line, but then it gave me red again... [Step8](Step8.jpg)
And so from there, I have no idea where to go, but I tried it again, and it says **remote origin already exists**. I am not sure if this was supposed to add anything to my github?
