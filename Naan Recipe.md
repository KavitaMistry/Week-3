# Whole Wheat Naan
## Ingredients
* Whole Wheat Flour
* Baking powder
* Salt
* Yogurt
* Butter
* Cilantro (optional)

## Instructions 
1.  Make self raising flour! Mix together 2 cups of all-purpose flour (I used Watson's Mill Whole Wheat Flour!!), 2 teaspoons of salt, and 2 tablespoons of baking powder. [April_27_1](April_27_1.jpg)

2. Make the dough! Add 1 cup of Greek yogurt to your self rising flour mixture. You can add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt if you would like but I normally don't. Adding salt takes away from the yogurt flavour a little bit!

3.   Mix your flour mixture and yogurt together with your hands until well combined! If your dough is a little too sticky add a little more flour. When you have a good dough, divide it into balls.

4.  Flour a surface lightly and a rolling pin and roll the dough balls out. This is where you can make fun shapes with the dough because...it's Naan! [April_27_2](April_27_2.jpg)

5.  Heat a non stick pan on medium heat. Cook one side of the naan for about 3 minutes, flip. and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Naan should puff up a little in the middle!

6.  Remove from pan, and brush with butter or garlic butter. Optional to sprinkle some coriander on top (if it doesn't taste like soap to you) and enjoy hot with your favourite curry! [April_27_3](April_27_3.jpg)

This recipe is best served fresh and warm.
